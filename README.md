-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project requires an NVIDIA graphics card with CUDA capability! Any card
after the Geforce 8xxx series will work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is a completely functional ray tracing engine implemented in CUDA.  Ray Tracing is a technique in computer graphics that generates images by backtracing rays of light through pixels on the screen into a scene. By approximating various physical effects, rays can be reflected, refracted, and shaded by various lighting sources. Depending on the complexity of the scene and the enabled features images will be rendered in real time to <1 FPS. At any rate, it's still a lot faster than a CPU implementation. More information about Ray Tracing can be found here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics).

Ultimately this project will go on to become a full fledged path tracer that solves a more general form of the same rendering problem using stochastic sampling.

CONTENTS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Project1 root directory contains the following subdirectories:
	
* src/ contains the source code for the project. Both the Windows Visual Studio
  solution and the OSX and Linux makefiles reference this folder for all 
  source; the base source code compiles on Linux, OSX and Windows without 
  modification. (Note: the OSX and Linux versions have not been tested recently, use at your own risk)
* scenes/ contains an example scene description file.
* renders/ contains an example render of the given example scene file. 
* PROJ1_WIN/ contains a Windows Visual Studio 2010 project and all dependencies
  needed for building and running on Windows 7.
* PROJ1_OSX/ contains a OSX makefile, run script, and all dependencies needed
  for building and running on Mac OSX 10.8. 
* PROJ1_NIX/ contains a Linux makefile for building and running on Ubuntu 
  12.04 LTS. Note that you will need to set the following environment
  variables: 
    
  - PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda-5.5/bin
  - LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-5.5/lib64:/lib

  you may set these any way that you like.
    

The Windows and OSX versions of the project build and run exactly the same way
as in Project0.

Features:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ray tracing engine implements several features:

* Raycasting from a camera into a scene through a pixel grid
* Phong lighting for multiple point light sources
* Diffuse surface rendering
* Raytraced soft shadows/area lighting
* Frame filtered progressive rendering
* Colored mirror reflection
* Simple refraction model
* Specular reflection 
* Supersampled adaptive antialiasing
* Minimally interactive camera

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interactive Controls
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The engine was designed so that many features could modified at runtime to allow easy exploration of the effects of various parameters. In addition, several debug modes were implemented that graphically display additional information about the scene. These options to result in more complex kernels that have a negative impact on performance. I preferred the flexibility to quickly experiment for this project, but in the path tracer I will be redesigning the kernel structure from the ground up with performance in mind.

Here's a complete list of the keypress commands you can use at runtime.


* A brief description of the project and the specific features you implemented.
* At least one screenshot of your project running.
* A 30 second or longer video of your project running.  To create the video you
  can use http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/Encoder4_Overview.aspx 
* A performance evaluation (described in detail below).




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The performance evaluation is where you will investigate how to make your CUDA
programs more efficient using the skills you've learned in class. You must have
perform at least one experiment on your code to investigate the positive or
negative effects on performance. 




One such experiment would be to investigate the performance increase involved 
with adding a spatial data-structure to your scene data.




Another idea could be looking at the change in timing between various block
sizes.




A good metric to track would be number of rays per second, or frames per 
second, or number of objects displayable at 60fps.




We encourage you to get creative with your tweaks. Consider places in your code
that could be considered bottlenecks and try to improve them. 




Each student should provide no more than a one page summary of their
optimizations along with tables and or graphs to visually explain and
performance differences.




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THIRD PARTY CODE POLICY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Use of any third-party code must be approved by asking on Piazza.  If it is
  approved, all students are welcome to use it.  Generally, we approve use of
  third-party code that is not a core part of the project.  For example, for the
  ray tracer, we would approve using a third-party library for loading models,
  but would not approve copying and pasting a CUDA function for doing refraction.
* Third-party code must be credited in README.md.
* Using third-party code without its approval, including using another
  student's code, is an academic integrity violation, and will result in you
  receiving an F for the semester.




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SELF-GRADING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* On the submission date, email your grade, on a scale of 0 to 100, to Liam,
  liamboone+cis565@gmail.com, with a one paragraph explanation.  Be concise and
  realistic.  Recall that we reserve 30 points as a sanity check to adjust your
  grade.  Your actual grade will be (0.7 * your grade) + (0.3 * our grade).  We
  hope to only use this in extreme cases when your grade does not realistically
  reflect your work - it is either too high or too low.  In most cases, we plan
  to give you the exact grade you suggest.
* Projects are not weighted evenly, e.g., Project 0 doesn't count as much as
  the path tracer.  We will determine the weighting at the end of the semester
  based on the size of each project.




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUBMISSION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As with the previous project, you should fork this project and work inside of
your fork. Upon completion, commit your finished project back to your fork, and
make a pull request to the master repository.  You should include a README.md
file in the root directory detailing the following




* A brief description of the project and specific features you implemented
* At least one screenshot of your project running, and at least one screenshot
  of the final rendered output of your raytracer
* A link to a video of your raytracer running.
* Instructions for building and running your project if they differ from the
  base code
* A performance writeup as detailed above.
* A list of all third-party code used

TAKUAscene FORMAT:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project uses a custom scene description format, called TAKUAscene.
TAKUAscene files are flat text files that describe all geometry, materials,
lights, cameras, render settings, and animation frames inside of the scene.
Items in the format are delimited by new lines, and comments can be added at
the end of each line preceded with a double-slash.

Materials are defined in the following fashion:

* MATERIAL (material ID)								//material header
* RGB (float r) (float g) (float b)					//diffuse color
* SPECX (float specx)									//specular exponent
* SPECRGB (float r) (float g) (float b)				//specular color
* REFL (bool refl)									//reflectivity flag, 0 for
  no, 1 for yes
* REFR (bool refr)									//refractivity flag, 0 for
  no, 1 for yes
* REFRIOR (float ior)									//index of refraction
  for Fresnel effects
* SCATTER (float scatter)								//scatter flag, 0 for
  no, 1 for yes
* ABSCOEFF (float r) (float b) (float g)				//absorption
  coefficient for scattering
* RSCTCOEFF (float rsctcoeff)							//reduced scattering
  coefficient
* EMITTANCE (float emittance)							//the emittance of the
  material. Anything >0 makes the material a light source.

Cameras are defined in the following fashion:

* CAMERA 												//camera header
* RES (float x) (float y)								//resolution
* FOVY (float fovy)										//vertical field of
  view half-angle. the horizonal angle is calculated from this and the
  reslution
* ITERATIONS (float interations)							//how many
  iterations to refine the image, only relevant for supersampled antialiasing,
  depth of field, area lights, and other distributed raytracing applications
* FILE (string filename)									//file to output
  render to upon completion
* frame (frame number)									//start of a frame
* EYE (float x) (float y) (float z)						//camera's position in
  worldspace
* VIEW (float x) (float y) (float z)						//camera's view
  direction
* UP (float x) (float y) (float z)						//camera's up vector

Objects are defined in the following fashion:
* OBJECT (object ID)										//object header
* (cube OR sphere OR mesh)								//type of object, can
  be either "cube", "sphere", or "mesh". Note that cubes and spheres are unit
  sized and centered at the origin.
* material (material ID)									//material to
  assign this object
* frame (frame number)									//start of a frame
* TRANS (float transx) (float transy) (float transz)		//translation
* ROTAT (float rotationx) (float rotationy) (float rotationz)		//rotation
* SCALE (float scalex) (float scaley) (float scalez)		//scale

An example TAKUAscene file setting up two frames inside of a Cornell Box can be
found in the scenes/ directory.
